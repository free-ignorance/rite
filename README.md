Rite API
=========

## Description:

This RESTful API returns a json object with Rituals or Rites, which are meant to be performed. 

## Scientific Connection to Rituals

“The findings are consistent with the longstanding view that ritual buffers against uncertainty and anxiety. Our results indicate that ritual guides goal-directed performance by regulating the brain’s response to personal failure.” 1.Hobson, N. M., Bonk, D. & Inzlicht, M. Rituals decrease the neural response to performance failure. PeerJ 5, (2017). ([link](https://peerj.com/articles/3363.pdf))
